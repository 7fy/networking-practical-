The system had worked quite well and, as happens in such cases, had taken on the status of a

The fact that no-one attended was an irrelevant detail. It was occasionally maintained that this meant 
that the lectures did not in fact happen at all, but no-one ever attended them to find out if this was true. 
Anyway, it was argued (by the Reader in Woolly Thinking, which is like Fuzzy Logic, only less so) that lectures 
had taken place in essence, so that was all right, too.

The system had worked quite well and, as happens in such cases, had taken on the status of a 
tradition. Lectures clearly took place, because they were down there on the timetable in black and white. 
The fact that no-one attended was an irrelevant detail. It was occasionally maintained that this meant 
that the lectures did not in fact happen at all, but no-one ever attended them to find out if this was true. 
Anyway, it was argued (by the Reader in Woolly Thinking, which is like Fuzzy Logic, only less so) that lectures 
had taken place in essence, so that was all right, too.
